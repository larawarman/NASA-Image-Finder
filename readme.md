#IBM Code Challenge
Build a flickr web-app that fetches images from Nasa's account via the Flickr API (API details). You are welcome to use any technology to build it and design the layout in any way that you see fit.

###From Lara:
I was inspired for this project by the [Earth View Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh?hl=en), where every time you open a new Chrome tab, you get a beautiful view of the Earth from above, via Google Earth. I thought that this would be a fun, different representation for the project.

I'm looking forward to discussing both positives and areas of improvement with you. I enjoyed the challenges of creating a quick, simple app and flexing my vanilla Javascript muscles.
