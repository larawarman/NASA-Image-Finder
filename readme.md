#The Challenge
Build a flickr web-app that fetches images from Nasa's account via the Flickr API (API details) using vanilla javascript.

###The Insiration:
I was inspired for this project by the [Earth View Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh?hl=en), where every time you open a new Chrome tab, you get a beautiful view of the Earth from above, via Google Earth. I thought that this would be a fun, different representation for the project.
